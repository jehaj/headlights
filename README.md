Inspired by the Just These and Sawdy 46 artworks at the exhibition at ARoS, this side-scroller game uses gameplay to show how many of us attempt to avoid taking responsibility by simply ignoring our surroundings. In this game, the character drives a car inspired by the Sawdy 46 car door. In the car window, the character imagines a side-scroller game to pass the time. The game features a small character dodging obstacles mirroring the surroundings outside the car. 

This creates a journey where the player travels through forest, wasteland and lastly, a warzone. The building tension is supported by a car radio describing the conflicts the character tries to distract themselves from.
